- ðŸ”­ I have a background as an accountant, but the search for added value led me to change my career to software development.
     After more than 600 hours dedicated to web application development, I have discovered an exciting new vocation. I am really enjoying this new chapter      in my professional career, always eager to learn new technologies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript.
