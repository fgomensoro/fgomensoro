- 🔭 I have a background as an accountant, but the search for added value led me to change my career to software development.
     After more than 600 hours dedicated to web application development, I have discovered an exciting new vocation. I am really enjoying this new chapter      in my professional career, always eager to learn new technologies. Currently I'm interested in developingsoftware solutions with **Javascript, ReactJs, NodeJs**.
- 🌱 Currently learning Typescript.
