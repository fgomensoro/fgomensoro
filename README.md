### Hi there 👋

<!--
**fgomensoro/fgomensoro** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I have a background as an accountant, but the search for added value led me to change my career to software development.
     After more than 600 hours dedicated to web application development, I have discovered an exciting new vocation. I am really enjoying this new chapter      in my professional career, always eager to learn new technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript.
